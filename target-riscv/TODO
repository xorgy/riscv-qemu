Notes for RISCV, updated priv spec version
-----------------------------------------------

General
-------
- fpu-custom-riscv aka softfloat is taken directly from spike (riscv-isa-sim)
  the current version is from 853391c2bb814451ad88b8dbff2aec8616fc6a12 of
  spike


OLD, left as notes:
-------------------
- In include/exec/cpu-defs.h, CPU_TLB_BITS has been set to zero for
  debugging purposes, increase for performance
    - this sets the TLBs to only hold one entry
