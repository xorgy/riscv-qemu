Notes for RISCV, priv spec version v1.9
-----------------------------------------------

This version is designed to match with commit 
65da94f84a2ba5a61a8bcf3ebdd8ca57f6d899ca of riscv-tools.

General
-------
- TODO: make sure all exception behavior is in line with spec (e.g. illegal
  instruction exceptions, etc)
- TODO: gdbstub needs to be fixed post 1.9 bump
- TODO: print useful csrs in riscv_cpu_dump_state in translate.c
- TODO: debug mode
- TODO: rvc, rv32

Testing
-------
- TODO: instructions cannot be fetched from pages that have MMIO regions - 
  this is only a problem when running riscv-tests
- hacking_files/fix_htif_page.diff has a hacky fix for this
- all relevant tests currently pass

OLD, left as notes:
-------------------
- In include/exec/cpu-defs.h, CPU_TLB_BITS has been set to zero for
  debugging purposes, increase for performance
    - this sets the TLBs to only hold one entry
- fpu-custom-riscv aka softfloat is taken directly from spike (riscv-isa-sim)
  the current version is from 853391c2bb814451ad88b8dbff2aec8616fc6a12 of
  spike. NOTE: fpu-custom-riscv has now been replaced with appropriately 
  configured softfloat library from qemu/fpu
